# EpicCSS
An open source project to build a css-framework (like Boostrap or Foundation)

This project is not about making the best or most popular framework, it is about learning HOW to create a framework, and how to contribute to open source. It is intented as a place to learn for new programmers and designers who are interested in CSS and learning how to contribute to open source.

This project was started by students at [Epicodus](http://epicodus.com), but is open to any interested student or jr. developer who wants to learn how to contribute to open source while practicing CSS.
